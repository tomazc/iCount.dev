<p class="lead mt-5">iCount: protein-RNA interaction analysis
</p>

{{< /blocks/cover >}}

{{% blocks/lead %}}
iCount is a Python module and associated command-line interface (CLI), which provides all the commands needed to process protein-RNA iCLIP interaction data and to identify and quantify sites of protein-RNA interactions on RNA.

iCount’s main input are FASTQ files with iCLIP sequencing data, its main output are BED files with identified and quantified cross-linked sites.

A number of analyses are included in iCount that provide insights into the properties of protein-RNA interaction.

<br>
iCount is developed and supported by Tomaž Curk from the Bioinformatics Laboratory at the University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Computer and Information Science and in collaboration with the laboratory of Jernej Ule. 
The development started in late 2008 when Tomaž Curk and Gregor Rot wrote a first prototype of iCount. A lot has happend since then. For details and full acknowledgments, see the how to cite section in the documentation.

iCount is a Python module and associated command-line interface (CLI), which provides all the commands needed to process protein-RNA iCLIP interaction data and to identify and quantify sites of protein-RNA interactions on RNA.

iCountâ€™s main input are FASTQ files with iCLIP sequencing data, its main output are BED files with identified and quantified cross-linked sites.

A number of analyses are included in iCount that provide insights into the properties of protein-RNA interaction.
